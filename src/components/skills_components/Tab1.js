Specifically, we scrutinize Hybrid One and Fischer-Heun for comparative analysis. The practical application of Skip Lists is explored, undergoing a performance assessment involving millions of operations (additions, checks, and removals) within a 10 million to 100 million range. This study aims to discern the practicality and efficiency of these RMQ algorithms, offering valuable insights for their real-world implementation and optimization.",

The process encompassed data cleansing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Various machine learning models, such as KNN, Naive Bayes, DT, Logistic Regression, GBDT, Random Forest, NN, and SVM, were constructed and compared. Notably, these models exhibited an impressive accuracy range of 95-98%. The project addresses the essential task of classifying flight delays, crucial for passenger convenience, and leverages Sklearn and Keras for implementation. It thoroughly evaluates and contrasts these models using evaluation metrics.",
